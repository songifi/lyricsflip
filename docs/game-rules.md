# Game Rules & Glossary

This document is the single source of truth for LyricsFlip game rules. Every rule below is
backed by a named function or constant in the contract. Source files:

- [`contracts/game/src/lib.rs`](../contracts/game/src/lib.rs) — entry points and constants
- [`contracts/game/src/types.rs`](../contracts/game/src/types.rs) — data structures
- [`contracts/game/src/events.rs`](../contracts/game/src/events.rs) — emitted events

If this document and the contract disagree, the contract wins — please open an issue.

Related issues: LF-005 (`rounds_won` tracking), LF-013 (scoring), LF-014 (payouts),

## Rounds

There are no fixed game modes. A round is a generic container for **1 to 8 players**.

- `get_max_players()` returns the current maximum number of players per round
  (default **8**).
- `set_max_players(admin, n)` updates the maximum. The contract rejects values below
  **2** (`MIN_PLAYERS`) or above the hard cap of **8** (`MAX_PLAYERS`).
- A round with a single player is a solo practice round; any number of players from 2 to
  `get_max_players()` compete in the same round.

> **Planned:** tournaments and brackets are not implemented. Tracked in LF-135.

## Round Lifecycle

1. **Created** — `create_round(...)` stores the round with its players, cards, and
   `start_time`. The round deadline is `start_time + ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS`.
2. **Active** — players submit answers via `submit_answer(...)` while
   `ledger.timestamp() < start_time + ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS`.
3. **Completed** — `complete_round(...)` (or `settle_round(...)` when a pool is
   involved) scores the answers, selects winners, updates `PlayerStats`, and emits
   `RoundCompleted { round_id, winners, scores }`.

`ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS` is **300** (5 minutes) — see
[`lib.rs`](../contracts/game/src/lib.rs).

## Card Timer

- Each card has an answer window of `CARD_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS` = **15** seconds,
  measured from the moment the card is presented to the player.
- An answer submitted **after** the window is still **accepted** and recorded, but it is
  **scored as wrong** (zero points). It is never rejected outright.
- A player who never submits an answer for a card scores zero for that card.

## Scoring

Points depend only on **how quickly** a correct answer arrives. Cards have no difficulty
(see *Planned* below).

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FIRST_LEDGER_GRACE_SECONDS` | **6** | Answers within this many seconds earn full points. |
| `MAX_CORRECT_POINTS` | **100** | Points for a correct answer inside the grace window. |
| `POINTS_DECAY_PER_SECOND` | **5** | Points lost for each second beyond the grace window. |
| `MIN_CORRECT_POINTS` | **10** | Floor — a correct answer never scores less than this. |
| `CARD_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS` | **15** | Answers after this are scored as wrong. |

All constants are defined in [`lib.rs`](../contracts/game/src/lib.rs).

The score for one correct answer is:

```
elapsed = answer_time - card_presented_time
if elapsed <= FIRST_LEDGER_GRACE_SECONDS:
    points = MAX_CORRECT_POINTS
else:
    points = max(MAX_CORRECT_POINTS - (elapsed - FIRST_LEDGER_GRACE_SECONDS) * POINTS_DECAY_PER_SECOND,
                 MIN_CORRECT_POINTS)
```

- Incorrect answers, missing answers, and answers after `CARD_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS`
  award **zero** points for that card.
- The round score is the sum of points across all cards in the round.

> **Planned:** card difficulty (easy/medium/hard multipliers) is not implemented.
> Tracked in LF-177.

## Streaks

- Consecutive correct answers update the player's **streak** in `PlayerStats`.
- Streaks **do not** change the points awarded for a card. They are a statistic only.
- An incorrect or missing answer resets the streak to zero.

## Winner Selection

Winners are chosen by `complete_round(...)` / `settle_round(...)` in this order:

1. **Highest round score** wins.
2. If scores tie, the player with the **lowest total answer time** wins.
3. If both score and total answer time tie, the round has **shared co-winners** — every
   tied player is recorded as a winner.
4. If **every** player scores zero, the round has **no winners**.

Each winner's `rounds_won` in `PlayerStats` is incremented by **1** (see LF-005).

## Fees & Payouts

- `settle_round(...)` splits the round pool into a **payout** and a **protocol fee**.
- The fee rate is snapshotted when the round is created, so later fee changes do not
  affect rounds already in flight.
- `MAX_FEE_BPS` = **1000** basis points (**10%**). `set_fee_bps(admin, bps)` rejects
  values above this cap.
- The fee is sent to the **treasury address snapshotted at round creation**.
- Admin changes emit `FeeUpdated` and `TreasuryUpdated` events.

> **Planned:** wager escrow and staking are not implemented. Tracked in LF-135.
> (Note: LF-005 was about `rounds_won`, not escrow.)

## Worked Example

Three players — **Ada**, **Bo**, and **Cy** — play a 3-card round. The pool is
**1,000** tokens, the fee is **500 bps (5%)**, and the treasury is `T`.

### Answers

| Player | Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ada | correct @ 4s | correct @ 9s | wrong |
| Bo | correct @ 6s | correct @ 12s | wrong |
| Cy | correct @ 10s | wrong | wrong |

### Scoring (time decay)

- **Ada:** Card 1 = 100 (within 6s). Card 2 = 100 − (9−6)×5 = **85**. Card 3 = 0.
  Total = **185**. Total answer time = 4 + 9 = **13s**.
- **Bo:** Card 1 = 100 (exactly 6s). Card 2 = 100 − (12−6)×5 = **70**. Card 3 = 0.
  Total = **170**. Total answer time = 6 + 12 = **18s**.
- **Cy:** Card 1 = 100 − (10−6)×5 = **80**. Cards 2 and 3 = 0. Total = **80**.
  Total answer time = **10s**.

### Winner

Ada has the highest score (**185**), so Ada wins outright. `RoundCompleted` is emitted
with `winners = [Ada]` and `scores = {Ada: 185, Bo: 170, Cy: 80}`. Ada's `rounds_won`
increases by 1.

### Tie-break illustration

Suppose Ada and Bo had both scored **185**. Ada's total answer time is **13s** and Bo's
is **18s**, so Ada still wins on the lower total answer time. If both had scored 185
*and* both had a total answer time of 13s, they would be **shared co-winners** and each
would gain +1 `rounds_won`.

### Fee & payout

- Fee = 1,000 × 500 / 10,000 = **50** tokens, sent to the snapshotted treasury `T`.
- Payout = 1,000 − 50 = **950** tokens, sent to Ada.

## Glossary

| UI term | Meaning | Contract behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Odds** | Not a contract concept. | **Remove from the UI.** There is no contract value to map it to. |
| **Pot / Pool** | Total tokens staked for a round. | **Planned** (LF-135). When implemented, `settle_round` splits it into payout + fee. |
| **Potential win** | Amount a player would receive if they win. | **Planned** (LF-135). Will be `pool − fee`, computed from the snapshotted fee rate. |
| **Difficulty** | How hard a card is. | **Not implemented** (LF-177). Cards have no difficulty; points depend only on answer time. |
| **Duration** | How long a player has to answer a card. | `CARD_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS` = **15s**. Late answers are accepted but scored as wrong. |
| **Round deadline** | When the round closes. | `start_time + ROUND_DURATION_SECONDS` = **300s**. |
| **Streak** | Consecutive correct answers. | Tracked in `PlayerStats` only; does **not** affect points. |
