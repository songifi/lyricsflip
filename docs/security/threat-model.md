# Threat Model & Invariants

This document is the supporting security analysis for the LyricsFlip project. It
complements [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) and should be read before
escrowing real funds (LF-146).

- **Scope:** on-chain contracts under `onchain/contracts/*`, the backend keeper,
  and the frontend/backend web applications.
- **Out of scope:** the Stellar network itself, Soroban host implementation, and
  third-party wallet software.

## 1. Actors

| Actor | Trust level | Capabilities | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Player** | Untrusted | Joins lobbies, submits answers, claims rewards. | May run many accounts (sybil) and scripted clients. |
| **Round admin** | Semi-trusted | Creates rounds, configures round parameters (entry fee, timing, card set). | Cannot move escrowed funds directly; can grief by misconfiguring. |
| **Card admin** | Semi-trusted | Adds/updates cards (lyrics, answers, metadata) and mints NFTs. | Controls answer correctness; a malicious card admin can leak answers. |
| **Owner** | Trusted (multisig recommended) | Upgrades contracts, sets admins, pauses, withdraws protocol fees. | Highest-privilege role; compromise is catastrophic. |
| **Backend keeper** | Semi-trusted | Submits transactions on behalf of the protocol (finalization, settlement, oracle-ish duties). | Holds a hot key; must be least-privilege and rate-limited. |
| **RPC provider** | Untrusted | Serves ledger state, submits transactions, may reorder/censor/delay. | Must not be trusted for correctness; contracts must validate on-chain. |

### Trust assumptions

- The **owner** key is held in a multisig / hardware wallet; single-key owner
  operation is a known risk accepted only pre-mainnet.
- The **backend keeper** key is a hot key with limited authority; it can only
  perform idempotent, on-chain-validated actions.
- The **RPC provider** is assumed Byzantine: it may lie, censor, or reorder, but
  cannot forge signatures. All security decisions are enforced on-chain.

## 2. Assets

| Asset | Location | Impact if compromised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Escrow** (entry fees, prize pools) | Contract token balances | Direct loss of player funds. |
| **NFTs** (card collectibles / rewards) | Contract + player wallets | Theft, duplication, or unauthorized minting. |
| **Stats** (scores, streaks, leaderboards) | Contract storage + backend DB | Reputation/integrity loss, unfair rewards. |
| **Admin/keeper keys** | Off-chain secrets | Full protocol compromise if leaked. |
| **Answer keys** (correct answers) | Contract storage / backend | Game integrity; leakage enables cheating. |

---

## 3. Attacks & Mitigations

### 3.1 Answer leakage
**Threat:** Correct answers are exposed before a round ends (via storage reads,
backend APIs, logs, or a malicious card admin), letting players cheat.

**Mitigations:**
- Do not store plaintext answers in publicly readable storage during an active
  round; commit to a hash and reveal after finalization, or gate reads.
- Backend endpoints serving round data must never include answer fields until
  the round is finalized.
- Card admin changes to an active round's answers are rejected.
- Audit logs must not print answer material.

### 3.2 Seed grinding
**Threat:** A player (or colluding keeper) influences or predicts the randomness
seed used to select cards/questions, biasing outcomes.

**Mitigations:**
- Derive randomness from a value committed *before* player participation
  (e.g., ledger sequence + pre-committed seed), not from player-supplied input.
- Reject seeds submitted after the round opens.
- Document that Soroban PRNG is not a VRF; for high-value rounds use a commit–
  reveal or external oracle.

### 3.3 Griefing lobbies
**Threat:** An attacker joins lobbies and never plays, or creates and abandons
lobbies to lock funds or deny service.

**Mitigations:**
- Entry fees are escrowed and refundable only via defined timeout paths.
- Lobbies have join/start deadlines; unfilled lobbies expire and refund.
- Rate-limit lobby creation per account; require minimum stake to create.

### 3.4 Abandoned rounds
**Threat:** A round is started but never finalized (keeper offline, admin
absent), leaving escrow stuck.

**Mitigations:**
- Permissionless finalization after a deadline: anyone (including players) can
  finalize an expired round.
- Keeper is idempotent and retried; finalization is safe to call multiple times
  (see invariant I3).
- Refund path for rounds that never reach quorum.

### 3.5 Key compromise
**Threat:** Owner, card admin, or keeper key is stolen.

**Mitigations:**
- Owner operations require multisig; upgrades time-locked.
- Keeper key is least-privilege and rotatable without redeploy.
- Card admin cannot move funds; separation of duties between roles.
- Pause switch (owner) to halt escrow operations during incident response.
- Key rotation and incident-response runbook referenced from `SECURITY.md`.

### 3.6 Additional considerations
- **Reentrancy / double-spend:** state is updated before token transfers; claims
  are marked before payout (see I2).
- **Integer overflow:** checked arithmetic in all balance math (see I1).
- **RPC censorship/reordering:** clients must confirm finality; keeper retries
  with idempotent operations.

## 4. Invariants

Each invariant is enforced in code and covered by a test. Tests live in
`onchain/contracts/*/src/test.rs`.

### I1 — Token conservation
> The sum of all token balances held by the contract plus all amounts paid out
> equals the sum of all amounts deposited. No operation creates or destroys
> tokens.

- **Enforced by:** escrow deposit/withdraw/claim paths using checked arithmetic
  and transferring exactly the recorded amounts.
- **Test:** `test_token_conservation` in
  [`onchain/contracts/escrow/src/test.rs`](../../onchain/contracts/escrow/src/test.rs)
  — deposits, plays a full round, and asserts
  `contract_balance + total_paid_out == total_deposited`.

### I2 — At most one claim per player per round
> A given player address can claim a reward for a given round at most once.

- **Enforced by:** a per-(round, player) `claimed` flag set *before* transfer;
  subsequent claims revert.
- **Test:** `test_double_claim_rejected` in
  [`onchain/contracts/escrow/src/test.rs`](../../onchain/contracts/escrow/src/test.rs)
  — claims once successfully, then asserts a second claim panics/reverts and the
  balance is unchanged.

### I3 — A finalized round is never re-finalized
> Once a round is marked finalized, any further finalization attempt is a no-op
> or reverts; the recorded outcome and payouts are immutable.

- **Enforced by:** a `finalized` flag checked at the top of the finalize path;
  finalization is idempotent and cannot alter prior payouts.
- **Test:** `test_finalize_is_idempotent` in
  [`onchain/contracts/round/src/test.rs`](../../onchain/contracts/round/src/test.rs)
  — finalizes a round, captures state, calls finalize again, and asserts state
  and balances are unchanged.

> **Maintenance:** when adding a new invariant, add it here with a link to its
> test. CI (`cargo test`) must pass for these tests on every PR.

## 5. Automated checks

The following run on every PR (see `.github/workflows/`):

- `cargo audit` — Rust dependency vulnerabilities (on-chain + backend).
- `npm audit --omit=dev` — frontend and backend production dependencies.
- CodeQL — static analysis for supported languages.

See [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) for how to report vulnerabilities.
