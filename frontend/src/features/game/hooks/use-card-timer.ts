/**
 * useCardTimer
 *
 * Per-card 15-second countdown for Issue #472 (LF-055), synced with the
 * contract's answer window for Issue #679 (LF-193).
 *
 * The contract opens the window when the `next_card` transaction is included
 * in a ledger (`CARD_ANSWER_WINDOW_SECONDS`, 15 s) and scores anything that
 * lands after it as wrong. A countdown that starts at render time therefore
 * keeps accepting clicks after the contract window has closed.
 *
 * When the caller supplies `startedAtMs` (the ledger close time of the
 * `next_card` transaction) the countdown is derived from that absolute
 * timestamp, minus one ledger of submission latency, so the UI closes early
 * rather than accepting an answer the contract will reject. Without an anchor
 * the hook keeps its original local countdown.
 *
 * - Start the timer whenever a new card is displayed.
 * - On timeout, call `onTimeout()` so the parent can flip the card and
 *   count the card as a miss.
 * - Stop the timer (and reset it) when `isActive` becomes false (e.g.
 *   the player answered or the component unmounts).
