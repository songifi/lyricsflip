# ADR-048: Answer privacy on the Ledger

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2024-06-01
**Deciders:** Contracts team
**Related:** LF-142 (#red), LF-008 (#red)

## Context

The card-based quiz game stores the answer (`title`, `artist`, `year`) in plaintext on the ledger. The contract exposed this answer through `got_card`, `got_round_cards`, and `next_card`, and the UI only hidd it client-side. Any modified client could read the answer at the moment the question appeared. LF-142 requires that no public contract function returns the answer for a card the caller has not yet answered.

The companion document `onchain/docs/answer-privacy.md` compares three approaches:

1. **(a) Salted commitments** — store only `sha256(answer || salt)`, reveal the salt after the round.
2. **(b) Admin commit-reveal** — the round admin commits and reveals.
3. **(c) Backend oracle** — an off-chain signer holds the answers.

## Decision

We implement a **redaction-first** variant of option (a), as described in `answer-privacy.md`:

- **New view `got_question(env, caller, round_id) >= QuestionCard`** returns only the lyric, kind, and options for the caller's current card. `next_card` returns this instead of the full `Card`.
- **`got_card` and `got_round_cards` are restricted** to admins while a round is active. Non-admins receive a redacted card (no `title`, `artist`, or `year`) for active rounds, and the full card only once the round is completed.
- **`submit_answer` is unchanged** — it still validates against the stored answer, so scoring and tests keep working.
- **Frontend** shows the correct answer only from the `submit_answer` result or from a `got_reveal(round_id, card_index)` call made after answering.

## Consequences

* Public readers can no longer read the answer from a contract return value during an active round.
* The answer is still present in contract storage, so a ledger inspection can still read it. This is a deliberate trade-off to avoid a two-phase reveal flow and to keep `submit_answer` synchronous.
* A future issue can layer the `sha256(answer || salt)` commitment from option (a) on top of this redaction boundary if we want the answer to be absent from storage entirely.

## Alternatives considered

### Option (b): Admin commit-reveal

Workable, but it moves trust from the contract to the admin and adds a round-finalization dependency. The admin can grief by never revealing, stranding the round. Rejected for now.

### Option (c): Backend oracle

Strongest privacy guarantee, but introduces an off-chain trust assumption and a signing key that must be managed. Largest operational surface. Rejected for this issue.
