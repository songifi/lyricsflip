/**
 * DataSource used by the TypeORM CLI (`npm run migration:*`). Points at

 * `TypeOrmModule.forRoot` already runs on boot (`migrationsRun`) — so the
 * CLI and the running app agree on one migration history.
 *
 * This is also what the `migrations` CI job diffs against: after
 * `migration:run` it runs `migration:generate --dryrun` (via
 * `npm run migration:check`) and fails if any SQL is produced. Because
 * `synchronize` is off and the entity set here is the same one the app
 * loads, an entity change that ships without a migration shows up as a
 * pending diff and fails CI instead of breaking at runtime.
